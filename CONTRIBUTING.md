and welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code](https://github.com/rickybassom/gmn-python-api)
- [Documentation](https://gmn-python-api.readthedocs.io/)
- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rickybassom/gmn-python-api/issues)

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rickybassom/gmn-python-api/issues).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case, and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rickybassom/gmn-python-api/issues).

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. 
Follow this [guide](https://cookiecutter-hypermodern-python.readthedocs.io/en/2022.6.3.post1/guide.html#getting-python-mac-linux-unix) to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and the required Python versions.

And the following tools:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)
- [nox-poetry](https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/)

Install the package with development requirements:

```sh
poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session, or the command-line interface:

```sh
poetry run python
```

```sh
poetry run gmn-python-api
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```sh
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```sh
nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session. For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```sh
nox --session=unit-tests
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory, and are written using the [pytest](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/) testing framework.

## How to build the documentation

```sh
nox --session=docs
```

Built documentation is located in the `docs/_build` directory.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request](https://github.com/rickybassom/gmn-python-api/pulls) to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:
- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
